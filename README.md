AppSniffer: Towards Robust Mobile App Fingerprinting Against VPN

# Abstract
Application fingerprinting is a useful data analysis technique for network administrators, marketing agencies, and security analysts. For example, an administrator can adopt application fingerprinting techniques to determine whether a user's network access is allowed. Several mobile application fingerprinting techniques (\eg \flowprint, \appscanner, and \etbert) were recently introduced to identify applications using the characteristics of network traffic. However, we find that the performance of the existing mobile application fingerprinting systems significantly degrades when a virtual private network (VPN) is used. To address such a shortcoming, we propose a framework dubbed \sys that uses a two-stage classification process for mobile app fingerprinting. In the first stage, we distinguish VPN traffic from normal traffic; in the second stage, we use the optimal model for each traffic type. Specifically, we propose a stacked ensemble model using Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and a FastAI library-based neural network model to identify applications' traffic when a VPN is used.
